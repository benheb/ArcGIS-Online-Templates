# Public Gallery

This PublicGallery template is designed for anyone who wants to showcase their ArcGIS Online maps, layers, and mobile apps in a dynamic web gallery.

This template is designed for anyone who wants to showcase their ArcGIS Online maps, layers, and mobile apps in a dynamic web gallery. The template allows you to control the content that fills the gallery using tools available in your ArcGIS Online account. This means that once you deploy a gallery, keeping gallery content up-to-date is as simple as sharing or un-sharing items in your ArcGIS Online group.
